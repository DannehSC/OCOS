# OCOS

## This is my attempt st an OpenComputers Operating System (OCOS).

The features I seek to add:
Interprocess permissions.
Three (or four if you enable it) sets of permissions.
Kernel/System, Admin, User, and optionally Guest.
Password protected accounts.
Possibly "biometrics" (basically it's tied to that user's username).
